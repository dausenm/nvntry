## About Me
    Hi! I’m Dausen — a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Alabama and the solo developer behind
    nvntry. My background is in the bar and restaurant industry, where I saw firsthand how much peace of mind inventory
    systems bring to operators. That inspired me to build a tool that brings the same level of organization to everyday life.

    This project is both a personal passion and a learning experience — I’m using it to deepen my skills in Dart and 
    Flutter, and to build something genuinely useful for others. Thanks for checking it out!

## nvntry
    nvntry (Pronounced "inventory") is a personal inventory tracking app. It allows users to document and categorize their stuff to be organized and always have
    an idea of what they have at home, in their car, at work, or wherever else you'd like to track.

## ## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
    Flutter SDK (version 3.10 or later recommended)

    Dart (comes with Flutter)

    A working IDE or text editor (VS Code, Android Studio, VIM if you're really into it, etc.)

    Optional: Android emulator, iOS simulator, or a physical device

## Installation
    1. Clone the Repository:
        git clone https://github.com/dausenm/nvntry.git
        cd nvntry

    2. Install Dependencies:
        flutter pub get

    3. Run the app:
        flutter run -d linux (or use -d android, -d chrome, etc.)

## Testing
    Currently no formal tests - manual testing is being used during this phase of development

## Features
    Add, edit, and delete items in your personal inventory

    Group items by category (e.g., Fridge, Closet, Car)

    Automatically sorted and displayed by category

    Dark mode toggle

    Settings panel with data wipe (for development/debug)

    Persistent local storage using Hive

    Clean, simple UI built with Flutter

## Planned Features
    Item image support (add photos for easier tracking)

    Barcode scanning for quicker item entry

    Search bar to quickly filter items by name

    Category-based filtering and sorting

    Persistent theme preference

    Analytics: restock suggestions based on usage patterns

    Export/share inventory (CSV, JSON, etc.)

    Cloud sync or backup for cross platform use

## Known Issues
    Currently no known issues (Not because I write bomb-proof code, but because I haven't done extensive testing. I'm sure you could find some)
